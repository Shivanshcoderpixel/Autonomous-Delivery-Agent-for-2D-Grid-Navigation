# Autonomous-Delivery-Agent-for-2D-Grid-Navigation
This repository contains the implementation of an autonomous delivery agent designed for navigating a 2D grid city environment to deliver packages efficiently while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. The project includes multiple path planning algorithms and a replanning capability for dynamic obstacles.
